## Smoke test: boots the real scene and plays it.
##
##   godot --headless --script res://test/run_smoke.gd
##
## The pure tests in run_tests.gd cannot see a wiring bug - a scene that fails
## to build, a node that is never added, a render path that stopped being
## flushed, a HUD reading a field that no longer exists. Those only show up
## when something actually instantiates the game.
##
## The load-bearing assertion is the last one: **the number of instances drawn
## must match the number of entities that exist.** A subsystem that renders
## nothing and a subsystem that does not exist look identical from outside.
## That exact bug has already cost a full tuning pass on another game here -
## the enemies were invisible while still charging and still killing, and it
## was read as a balance problem for days.

## The controls must be ANCHORED to the viewport, never placed at a literal
## coordinate.
##
## A structural assertion rather than a behavioural one, because the bug it
## guards against is invisible at the size the tests run. The project stretches
## with `aspect = "expand"`, which keeps the base WIDTH and extends the HEIGHT -
## so on a 19.5:9 phone the canvas is about 1080x2340 while the base is
## 1080x1920. Controls laid out against the literal 1920 drew hundreds of pixels
## above where they belonged, and the report was "the icons are about half an
## inch too high".
##
## **A headless run uses the base size, where the wrong layout and the right one
## are identical** - so no screenshot or coordinate check taken here could ever
## have caught it. What CAN be checked is the property that makes it impossible.

## A finished level must start the next one.
##
## The assertion an earlier version of this template did not have, and the one
## that would have caught the first bug a game built from it shipped: `over`
## went true at the end of a level, `advance()` returned early from then on, and
## the game froze with a live HUD.
##
## Every other test in the suite plays a level and reads the state at the END,
## which is the exact instant that freeze begins. **A suite that always stops
## where the content stops cannot see past the end of the content**, so this one
## deliberately drives THROUGH the boundary - and through the real scene, since
## the missing code was in the renderer's handler and not in Sim.
